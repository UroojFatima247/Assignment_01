# Selenium Playground - UI Automation Assignment

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my completed **UI Automation Assignment** for the Selenium Playground course.  
The objective of this assignment was to design, implement, and execute automated test cases on various UI components of the [Selenium Playground](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground) application.

All test scripts are written using **Playwright** with a structured **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to ensure clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

The repository demonstrates core automation testing skills such as handling alerts, form submissions, dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, and drag-and-drop functionality.
